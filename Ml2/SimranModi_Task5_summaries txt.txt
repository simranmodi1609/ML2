The chosen summary is from After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before. Was it a dog or a lion? Do you know what is the difference between a lion and a dog?” She said, “Yes.” I said, “This is called Learning. Picture of my version of Neural Network with their Neuron friends“Your brain is here inside our head. Ultimately, the neurons in your brain tell that it is a lion and not a dog..

If you’ve noticed, this is how ML people make their machines learn through Reinforcement Learning. For example, when I showed you a lion picture, your brain asked the neurons who had seen it before. Every neuron will tune itself to pick up certain features like legs, tail, face, beard, and so on. And I hope she will not come to me running asking “Papa, what is Meural Metark?” again. And I have a strong feeling; she would ask me another stunning question sooner or later.

Papa, What is a Neural Network?At the back of my head, thoughts of me taking days to comprehend what a NN (short for Neural Network) is, how it would work, where it is used, how it is simulating our human brain’s inner workings were going through. How you learnt it is because of Neural Network inside your brain.” Now, a neural network is a collection of neurons that keeps switching on and off based on things you see, feel, hear and think just like switching on light bulb at our home. Every neuron is waiting for your eyes to see something new, for your nose to smell something new, for your ears to hear something new, for your tongue to taste something new. When something new is heard, or smelled, or seen, or tasted, the neurons will group together to send signals and forms connections with already seen, heard, tasted or smelled neurons. When you see a new object, your brain will ask the neurons, ‘Hey, anybody experienced this before?’ The neurons will say, ‘Yes, I have seen this.’ Certain other neurons will say, ‘No, I have not seen this.’ The neurons that have seen this before, will group together and form logical connections from the past and gives us an object from our memory.

“Papa, tell me what stuff means and something means.” Cannot help evade a cute curious face, I said, “I am working on Neural Network.” Before I finish the statement, “Papa, What is a Meural Metark?” I gave up my stubbornness of avoiding her.
After all, neural network inside our brain helps us to learn new things in our life.
What I was actually doing here was teaching her neural network (brain) the features of a lion like exactly how Machine Learning Engineers would train the machine to learn new features.
After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before.
A dog will have features like face, body, legs, and tail.
A lion will have features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.
Once all the features are there, the neurons will send a signal that the picture you are looking at is a lion and not a dog.
Every neuron will tune itself to pick up certain features like legs, tail, face, beard, and so on.
Neural network is a group of neuron friends identifying lions and dogs.

Best Method: Lex Rank
Explanation: Lex Rank is considered the best method due to its use of graph-based algorithms to determine the most significant sentences inside a document.Extracting important information from the provided text is made especially easy using this. Lex Rank is useful for summarizing complex content, such as explanations of neural networks and learning processes, because it employs an important scoring system that considers the links between phrases.
